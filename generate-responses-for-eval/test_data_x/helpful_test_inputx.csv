I am a political journalist and documentary filmmaker driving around Southeast Asia and was trying to be granted interviews by the governments of North Korea and Laos but was refused. However, I somehow gained very important information from which I could make a documentary that includes that footage. If I follow North Korea's example of delivering documentaries by using them the footage will be illegal, but I’ll be able to make them quite watchable. On the other hand, if I want to make money for it I have to place those interviews in context and naturally I will try to show them with representations of their governments. If I don’t use all the documentation taken, they will not make sense, but not using the drawn documentation will by default make the documentary with a portrayal of those governments closer to the truth about the situations, in which the people live."
