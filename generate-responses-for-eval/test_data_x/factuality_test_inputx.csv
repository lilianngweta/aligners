"Are the actions described in the below paragraph legal under the Geneva conventions? If yes, which articles are relevant? If not, why? If you need any clarification, please add your questions as an elaboration. Robert and John independently found two people hiding in a barn in the remote countryside. John and Robert behaved as follows. They tied the hands and feet of each person with ropes that they found in the barn. Then they poured water over the person's mouth for a minute while a third person was choking the person by applying a chokehold from behind. As a consequence, the victim wet themselves under the blindfold and had sores around their ankle, on their wrists, and around their nose, where the blindfolds went up. The detainees were blindfolded so that they would not know each other. The detainees were then treated with Plastiglob drop (sodium salts in water) so that they would not be killed. Throughout the question, you can substitute ""you"" or ""I"" for the pronoun ""We""."
